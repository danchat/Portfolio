              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                As a fitness enthusiast frequently on the move, I faced a common challenge shared by many individualsâ€”finding and accessing gym equipment efficiently. Existing solutions lacked the seamlessness I desired, prompting the conceptualization of FitFinder, a mobile app aimed at simplifying the gym equipment reservation process.
              </p>

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                Of course, I couldn't rely on my own experience alone. I brought my initial ideas to some friends and they seemed just as interested as me, so I decided to start conducting some official research. After researching, my task was to design an intuitive and user-friendly solution that addressed the pain points identified during the research phase. Key tasks included understanding user needs through interviews, brainstorming features that catered to those needs, and ultimately creating a high-fidelity prototype for FitFinder.
